          <h4>Licensed Educational Content License Grant</h4>
          <p>
            Unless indicated as being in public domain, all educational Content provided on the Website by Portfoliyo (the “<em>Licensed Educational Content</em>”) is protected by United States copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. Unless otherwise indicated, all Licensed Educational Content is the property of Portfoliyo or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and/or third-party licensors and is licensed to You under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License (available at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/</a>) (the “<em>Creative Commons License</em>”). By downloading or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Content, You agree to comply with all the terms of the Creative Commons License. Portfoliyo reserves all rights in the Licensed Educational Content not expressly granted in the Agreement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Licensed Educational Content License Restrictions</h4>
          <p>
            The Licensed Educational Content is intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, the Licensed Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for “commercial advantage or private monetary compensation” under the Creative Commons License unless otherwise agreed in writing by Portfoliyo.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is “non-commercial” depends on the use, not the user. Portfoliyo defines as “non-commercial” any use that is not directly intended to generate sales or profits for the user. As an example, the use by a for-profit corporation of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development and/or training of its employees is “non-commercial” as long as that corporation does not charge its employees for such use. As another example, the use by a non-profit corporation of the Licensed Educational Content for the training of its clients in return for a fee is NOT “non-commercial”.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Portfoliyo strives to make the Licensed Educational Content freely available to as wide an audience as possible. Therefore, if you have any questions or concerns regarding whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is allowed under this license, please contact Portfoliyo at <span class="email">info(put the 'at' sign here)theknetwork.org</span> for guidance. Without limiting the generality of the terms of the Creative Commons License, the following are types of uses that Portfoliyo expressly defines as falling outside of the definition of "non-commercial": the sale or rental of any part of the Licensed Educational Content, any derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or any collective work that includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                the sale of access or a link to any part of the Licensed Educational Content without first obtaining informed consent from the buyer that the buyer is aware that the Licensed Content or such part thereof is available at the Website free of charge;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

Please contact your credit card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.
